Description: GNU C preprocessor - Android prebuilt
 A macro processor that is used automatically by the GNU C compiler to
 transform programs before actual compilation.
 .
 This package has been separated from gcc for the benefit of those who
 require the preprocessor but not the compiler.
 .
 This package contains preprocessor configured for arm64 architecture, as
 taken from the Android source tree.

Description: GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities - Android prebuilt
 The programs in this package are used to assemble, link and manipulate binary and
 object files. They may be used in conjunction with a compiler and various
 libraries to build programs. 
 .
 This package contains the prebuilt applications as taken from the Android source
 tree (gcc @BASE_VERSION@).
